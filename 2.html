  <p><strong>The identity for a proposed adaptive reuse park along the Williamsburg, Brooklyn, waterfront captures the creative spirit of the neighborhood</strong></p>
  <img src="london.jpg" width="100%">
  <p>Maker Park is a proposed adaptive reuse park that will revitalize an unused industrial site on the waterfront in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Conceived by a group of community activists, the initiative will transform the seven-acre site formerly known as the Bayside Fuel Terminal into a hub for artists, makers and entrepreneurs. Pentagram has designed a bright, colorful identity for the park that captures the creative spirit of the neighborhood and helps raise the plan’s profile as it seeks support.</p>
