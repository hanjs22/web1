  <p><strong>Identity and signage for the central avenue and destination in downtown Minneapolis.</strong></p>
  <img src="london.jpg" width="100%">
  <p>Nicollet Avenue is the “Main Street” of downtown Minneapolis, a cultural and commercial center and shopping and dining district that attracts people to work, shop and eat year round. The thoroughfare recently reopened after undergoing a major renovation to make it more pedestrian friendly. As part of the revitalization, Pentagram has designed a brand identity and comprehensive program of signage, wayfinding and environmental graphics for Nicollet that capture the spirit of the street and its place in the city.</p>
  <p>Running between Loring Park and the Mississippi River, Nicollet is home to flagship stores, major corporations, public transit hubs, and landmarks like IDS Center and Orchestra Hall, and fits into the city’s extensive network of skyway systems linking buildings in downtown. Eight blocks of Nicollet were closed to automobile traffic in 1967, establishing the first pedestrian and transit “mall” in the US and pioneering the concept as a national model of urban innovation that inspired pedestrian malls in other cities.</p>
