  <img src="london.jpg" width="100%">
  <p>Pentagram is the world’s largest independently-owned design studio.

Our work encompasses graphics and identity, architecture and interiors, products and packaging, exhibitions and installations, websites and digital experiences, advertising and communications. Our 19 partners are all practicing designers, and whether they are working collaboratively or independently, they always do so in friendship.

Our structure is unique. We are the only major design studio where the owners of the business are the creators of the work and serve as the primary contact for every client. This reflects our conviction that great design cannot happen without passion, intelligence and — above all — personal commitment, and is demonstrated by a portfolio that spans five decades and all industries..</p>
